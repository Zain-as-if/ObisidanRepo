Regular expressions are a formal language for specifying text strings

<h4>Regular Expressions: Disjunctions</h4>
Letters inside square brackets []

| Pattern      | Matches              |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| [wW]oodchuck | Woodchuck, woodchuck |
| [123456789]  | Any Digit            |
Ranges [A-Z]

| Pattern | Matches              |                                     |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [A-Z]   | An upper case letter | **D**renched Blossoms               |
| [a-z]   | A lower case letter  | **m**y beans were impatient         |
| [0-9]   | A single digit       | Chapter **1**: Down the rabbit hole |
<h4>Regular Expressions: Negation in Disjunction</h4>
Negations [\^Ss]
- Carat (^) means negation only when first in []

| Pattern | Matches                  |                                |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| [\^A-Z] | Not an upper case letter | O**y**fn pripetchik            |
| [\^Ss]  | Neither 'S' nor 's'      | **I** have no exquisite reason |
| [\^e^]  | Neither e nor ^          | Look h**e**re                  |
| a^b     | The pattern a carat b    | Look up **a^b** now            |
<h4>Regular Expressions: More Disjunction</h4>
The pipe | for disjunction
**? * + .**

| Pattern | Matches                |                             |
| ------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| colou?r | Optional prev char     | **color    colour**         |
| oo*h!   | 0 or more of prev char | **oh! ooh! oooh! ooooh!**   |
| o+h!    | 1 or more of prev char | **oh! ooh! oooh! ooooh!**   |
| baa+    |                        | **baa baaa baaaa**          |
| beg.n   |                        | **begin begun begun beg3n** |
**Anchors: ^ $**

| Pattern      | Matches                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| \^[A-Z]      | **P**alo Alto             |
| \^[\^A-Za-z] | **1** **"**Hello"         |
| \\.$         | The end**.**              |
| .$           | The end**?** The end**!** |

Example Regex:
Find me all instances of word "the" in a text.
- <u>the</u> - Misses capitalized examples
- [tT]he - Incorrectly returns o**the**r or **the**ology
Correct Answer:
[\^a-zA-Z]\[tT]he[\^a-zA-Z]
Returns the pattern "the" or "The" with spaces on either side, therefore all instances of the word <u>the</u>

Process we just went through was based on fixing 2 kinds of errors:
1. Matching strings that should not have matched (**the**re, **the**n, o**the**r) <u>False Positives (Type 1 Errors)</u>
2. Not matching things that we should have matched (The) <u>False Negatives (Type 2 Errors</u>

Reducing error rate for an application often involves 2 antagonistic efforts:
- Increasing accuracy or precision (minimising false positives)
- Increasing overall coverage or recall (minimising false negatives)
