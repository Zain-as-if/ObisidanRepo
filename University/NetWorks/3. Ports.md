Applications are linked to the Transport layer via **network ports**.
- Different port numbers can be associated with different application layer processes
- This allows multiple applications to run simultaneously on the same host with the same IP address
- Purely software, provided by the OS
- Can be allocated to a particular service, e.g email, http

Converting host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is the job of the Transport layer. 
- known as multiplexing (sending) and demultiplexing (receiving)

Applications typically publish the port they are listening to (receiving on)
- Sending process will attempt to establish a connection using the published port number
- Will continue to communicate using the same port number, but the port can also be used to initiate new contacts

<h4>Available Ports</h4>
Ports 1-65535 are available on any given host
- 16-bit unsigned int, with zero not allowed
- TCP and UDP ports and independent
Ports are characterised by:
- Ports 1-1023 reserved; approved by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- Commonly used ports lie outside this range, i.e. 1024-65535
- We can use any freely available ports in this range

E.g:
**telnet:**
- Port 23
- Short for Teletype Network
- The original client-server communication protocol
- Now rarely used as insecure
**ssh:**
- Port 22
- Secure Shell
**ftp:**
- Stands for File Transfer Protocol
- Port 21 for commands (dir, put, get, etc)
- Port 20 used for data (the original use; slow)
**smtp:**
- Port 25
- Stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- Used for sending emails
**imap:**
- Port 143
- Used to access email
- Stands for Internet Message Access Protocol
**pop3:**
- Port 110
- Also used to access email
- Stands for Post Office Protocol
**http:**
- Port 80
- Stands for HyperText transfer protocol
- Insecure
**https:**
- Port 443
- Secure version of http, requiring authentication

At Application layer, data to be sent to the destination host and port number is packaged for transport.

The Transport layer is oblivious to the subnet that enables the communication.
- Adds a header that includes information such as port numbers, checksum, etc
At Network layer and below, the subnet is explicitly involved.
- e.g. The Network layer determines which network nodes the message will pass through

2 Key protocols for the Transport layer:
- UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

Differ in: 
- Information provided in their headers
- Reliability of service
- Performance

Both checksum for data integrity

<h4>UDP</h4>
Connectionless protocol
- Each message is independent

Prepends an 8-byte header to the message including:
- Destination port number
- Source port number
- Message length
- Checksum

Port identifies the processes on both the source and destination hosts.
Has a checksum for data integrity, but simply discards data segments that have been corrupted.

UDP Header:![[Pasted image 20250131123744.png]]
No host (IP) addresses in the header for UDP, and same is true for TCP
- This is responsibility of the Network layer

An important use of UDP is to access a DNS (Domain Name System) server, to map a readable internet address to an IP address.

Also useful for real-time multi-media, often wrapped into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).
- Sits between Application & Transport layers
- UDP packets are numbered such that receiver can determine if packets are missing
- No correction or retransmission
- Receiver can interpolate lost data

<h4>TCP</h4>
Connection-oriented protocol, i.e. maintains a persistent connection between 2 hosts.
- Ensures reliable data transfer, possibly requesting re-transmission of lost or corrupt segments
- Also provides a degree of congestion control

20-byte header:
- Sequence and acknowledgement numbers
- Bits used for maintaining the connection
- Some specialist fields
Remaining fields are same as UDP.
Sequence and acknowledgment numbers are used to guarantee ordering, and to check for missing packets.![[Pasted image 20250131124235.png]]
<h4>Network Layer - IP</h4>
Forwards Transport layer data with a 20-byte (IPv4) / 40-byte (IPv6) header.
- Source and destination address (IPv4 or IPv6)
- Protocol (TCP / UDP)
- Checksum for the header integrity (IPv4)
- Time-to-live
Time-to-live decrements whenever the datagram (packet) passes through a network node. Once it reaches zero, the message is discarded.
- Avoids datagrams that circulate forever

Frames of data are forwarded to the Physical layer. E.g. ethernet frames have a 22-byte header containing: 
- Preamble, used for synchronisation
- MAC address for source and destination
- Type field (e.g. for ARP)
Also checksum, although is often in a footer.
Checksum is for frame integrity.
The MAC address enables the frame to 'hop' to the next network device.
![[Pasted image 20250131124716.png]]
Note each header has a source and destination 'address':
- Ports in between the Transport and Application layers
- IP Addresses in the Network layer
- MAC Addresses in the Link layer
<h4>Network Transmission</h4>
The route from source to destination passes through multiple devices (typically).

Network-layer routers determine the path between hosts.

Link layer bridges and switches forward frames between network components. 

Physical layer repeaters and hubs regenerate the signal, thereby enabling a greater range.![[Pasted image 20250131124945.png]]
Headers are prepended to data at most levels as it is being sent, and removed at the same level as it is being received. Naming and addressing is key.
- MAC Addressing at the Link layer (not relevant to programming)
- IP Addressing at the Network layer, allows high-level specification of source and destination
- Port Numbering at the Transport layer allows specific referencing to applications
