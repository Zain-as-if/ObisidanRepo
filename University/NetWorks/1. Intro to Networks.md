First computer network was ARPAnet at MIT, when in 1969 two machines were connected together.
- Used a **packet switch**, similar to phone networks
- Built on technologies developed by MIT, Rand Institute, and the National Physical Laboratory, UK.
- By 1972 had 15 nodes
Followed by many others: ALOHANet linking Hawaiian universities via microwaves; DARPA networks for defence; the commercial Telenet; Cyclades in France , etc.

Interconnecting networks, or a network of networks, was pioneered by Cerf & Kahn in 1974.
- Was termed **internetting**...
- ... from which we get word **internet**
- Development of **protocols**, including an early version of **TCP = Transmission Control Protocol**

Common network features:
- **Hosts** or **end systems** at start and end of chain of communication
- Includes **servers**
- **Routers**
- **Edge routers** or **access network** that directly connect to an end system

Early residential access used standard phone lines & modems, and transmitted data as sound.
- Could not use phone and browse at the same time
- Typically slow
- Improved with **ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)** which downloads faster than uploads

More common these days to have a **base station** that transmits to multiple **hosts** 'simultaneously'
- 802.11b/g, up to newer versions, e.g 802.11be
- Up to gigahertz frequency bands

Wider-area standard for phones:
- 3G ~ 7 Mbps
- 4G ~ 100 Mbps
- 5G ~ 10 Mbps

Companies / Universities connect **end systems** to the **edge router**
