Network communication is implemented through a network **stack**.
**Protocols** are defined to pass messages between layers.
This **modular design** allows internal components to be easily replaced.
- Restricts functionality at each level, so easier to understand
Potential for **redundancy** - overlapping operations carried out at more than one level.

Ideally a network layer model should:
- Create layers where a separate **abstraction** required
- Each layer has a well-defined **function**
- Layer boundaries minimise the data flow across the boundary

Each layer implements a service which relies on services provided by the layer below

These concepts identical to **object oriented** programming:
- Implementation within each layer is **private**
- Communication between layers is the public **interface**
**Modularisation** eases maintenance and updating of the system.
- Changes in implementation of one layer's service is transparent to the rest of the system
- e.g Change in gate procedures does not affect the rest of the system

<h4>Open Systems Interface (OSI)</h4>
7 layer stack
Applies to networks <u>in general</u>
Developed in 1970s

![[Pasted image 20250130145949.png]]

**Application** layer contains the user-facing protocols:
- ftp, http, smtp, ...

**Presentation** layer used to interpret data:
- Includes compression & encryption protocols
- Also data description (i.e format)

**Session** layer organises and structures the dialogue between applications:
- Delimited & synchronisation

<h4>Transport Layer</h4>

(Downwards) Accept session data and splits into **segments** before passing to the Network layer.

(Upwards) Receives Network layer segments and constructs Session layer data.

Data integrity depends on the protocol

Host-to-host communication
- Includes destination address in header
- Oblivious to network infrastructure

<h4>Network Layer</h4>
Controls the operation of sub-network between hosts.
Determines how packets (often called **datagrams** for this layer) are routed **dynamically**:
- Links may be made or broken as machines are added to the network, break down etc.
May also offer **congestion control** and **quality service**.
Highest level of protocol stack for simple routers:
- routers do not need Transport or Application layers, but will often have software to help routing, firewalls etc.

<h4>Link & Physical Layer </h4>
**Link** layer, sometimes known as the Data Link layer, handles movement of **frames** (packets) from node-to-node along the route.
- Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and combinations
- This is layer at which **MAC (Media Access Control)** addresses are relevant
**Physical** layer handles movement at the bit level.
- Copper wire, fibre optic, radio waves etc.
- Purely 'Hardware'

<h4>Pro & Con of OSI model</h4>
Pros:
- Clearly defined layers & protocols
- Very general design that could be applied to any network, not just internet
Cons: 
- Often overly complex
- **Presentation** & **Session** layers have minimal functionality that could easily be subsumed into **Application** layer

<h4>TCP/IP 5-Layer</h4>
Most widely used mode for the internet, simplified version of OSI model:
Application -> Transport -> Network -> Link -> Physical
- **Presentation** and **Session** layers merged into **Application**
- **Network** layer sometimes called the **internet** layer
- **Link** and **Physical** layer sometimes merged to give 4-layer model

**Physical** layer is where date is converted to/from e.g. electrical or radio signals:
- May involve digital-to-analogue conversion
- Sometimes merged with the **Link** layer
**Link** layer controls how packets transported between network nodes:
- How e.g. your device or laptop detected by a Wi-Fi network
- Error checking, **may be redundant** (i.e. repeated at another level)

Most common protocol is **Internet Protocol** (IP).
- Describes how data is grouped into **datagrams** (packets)
- The network **addressing scheme**

A **datagram** is produced containing the data and header information

Also **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**, which is how routers communicate to ensure efficient transport of messages through the network.

Java only understands IP.

Raw data packets can be corrupted, arrive out-of-order, or not arrive at all!

2 Protocols exist at this layer

| TCP | <u>T</u>ransmission <u>C</u>ontrol <u>P</u>rotocol<br>- Ensures all packets/segments received<br>- May ask for re-transmission<br>- Can have high overhead |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UDP | <u>U</u>ser <u>D</u>atagram <u>P</u>rotocol<br>- Detects corruption, but not ordering or lost packets/segments<br>- Low overhead                           |
**User code** and **interface** reside in **Application** layer.
Sends data into the **Transport** layer, and delivers data to the user from the **Transport** layer.

The protocol used determines what is done with incoming data:
- http - display in browser
- ftp - deliver data file
- smtp - for sending email
Can create user-defined protocols

<h4>Pro & Con of TCP/IP model</h4>
Pros:
- Suited to network programming
- Simpler than OSI model
- Well suited to internet
Cons:
- Layers and protocols not always clearly defined
- Lacks generality
