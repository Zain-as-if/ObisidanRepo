Define a module of computation for strings.
- A string is a finite sequence over some finite set of symbol, called the alphabet (usually denoted by Σ)
- A language over an alphabet Σ is a set of strings over Σ (usually denoted L)
- If w is a string over Σ then the length of w, denoted |w|, is the number of symbols in the sequence
- The symbol **∈** denotes the **empty string**, which has length 0 
- w = w<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>w<sub>3</sub>...w<sub>n</sub> where w<sub>i</sub> ∈ Σ for all 1 <= i <= n is a string of length n over alphabet Σ whose first element is w<sub>1</sub>, whose second element is w<sub>2</sub>, etc...

A **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F), where:
- **Q** - finite set called *states*
- **Σ** - finite set called *alphabet*
- **δ** - Q * Σ -> Q is the *transition function*
- **q<sub><strong>0</strong></sub>** ∈ Q is the *start state*
- **F** ⊆ Q is set of *accepting states*

Let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F) be a finite automaton and let w = w<sub>1</sub>...w<sub>n</sub> be a string where w<sub>i</sub> ∈ Σ. The automaton M accepts w if a sequence of states r<sub>0</sub>,...,r<sub>n</sub> ∈ Q exists such that:
1. r<sub>0</sub> = q<sub>0</sub>
2. δ(r<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i+1</sub>) = r<sub>i+1</sub> for 0 <= i < n
3. r<sub>n</sub> ∈ F

<h4>Notation</h4>
Set of **Natural** numbers, denoted **ℕ**, is set {1, 2, 3, ...}
Set of **Integers**, denoted **ℤ**, is set {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}

Sequence of objects is a list of these objects in some order. A sequence is denoted using parentheses. A sequence may be finite or infinite, finite sequences called tuples.

A string is a sequence of symbols. Set of symbols from which the elements of a string come from is called the alphabet. Alphabet may vary depending on the application. The only requirement is that the alphabet is a non-empty and finite set. Generally we denote the alphabet in a particular context as Σ or Γ. The elements of an alphabet are typeset in a typewriter font to differentiate them from normal text.

Σ<sub>1</sub> = {0, 1}
Σ<sub>2</sub> = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z}

A string over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from that alphabet, usually written next to each other other, w/o commas. For example if Σ = {0, 1} then 010011010 is a string over Σ. If w is a string over Σ then the length of w, denoted |w|, is the number of symbols in the sequence.
