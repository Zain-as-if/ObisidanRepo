When carrying out uniform cost search we always expand the node that has the least total cost to reach from the goal. 

**Total cost to reach a node is obtained by adding the cost of each action along the path from the start node to that node.**

If several nodes have the same total cost we can pick several of them.

If all actions have same cost, then uniform cost search same as BFS.
