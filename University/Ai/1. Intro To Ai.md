**Percept** - Agent's input at a given moment, detected by a sensor and processed 
<h4>Levels of Intelligence</h4>
- **Weak** (aka Narrow) AI - Refers to the capability of software to perform specific tasks of a kind one would describe as requiring intelligence
- **Strong** (aka General) AI - Highly adaptive capability, can be applied to achieving a potentially unlimited range of tasks. Generally assumed humans have this.
- **Super-Intelligence** - Goes significantly beyond that of any human

<h4>Intelligent Agents</h4>
Basic concepts of an AI system in terms of the following stages:
- Define an **agent**
- Specify the notion of **rational behaviour**, as conception of intelligence that is subject to objective analysis and investigation
- Classify different kinds of AI tasks in terms of **environment types**
- Classify **agent types** in terms of the way they interact with and process information about their environment

An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. 

Different kinds of agent will have different kinds of sensors & actuators.

<h4> The Concept Of Rationality </h4>
Assumption: A rational agent is one that does the 'right thing'
What is the right thing? 
- Agent should do actions that enable it to be the **most successful**
- We need to take into account its **possible actions**
- We need a way to measure success: **a performance measure**
- May be difficult to specify what is best

What is rational depends on 4 things:
- Performance measure
- Agent's prior knowledge of the environment
- Actions the agent can perform
- Agent's percept sequence to date

**Rational Agent**: For each possible percept sequence, rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximise its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built in knowledge the agent has.

<h4>Task Environments</h4>
Identify properties of environments that may be relevant to AI design:
- Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable : Do sensors detect all aspects of the environment.
- Deterministic vs. Stochastic : Is the next state determined completely by the current state and the action taken?
- Episodic vs. Sequential : Episodic means that the task can be broken into separate periods that don't affect each other.
- Static vs. Dynamic : Dynamic environment can change while agent is deciding what to do.
- Discrete vs. Continuous
- Single Agent vs. Multi-Agent

<h4>Agent Types</h4>
Simple Reflex Agent:
Simplest kind of agent. Can only react to its immediate perception of the environment:

Model-Based Reflex Agent: 
Does not just react to its most recent perceptual input. Uses perceptions to build a model of its environment and its action rules based on accumulated knowledge of world state:

Goal-Based Agent: 
Instead of simply basing actions on current state of the system, also has knowledge of its goals and how they might be achieved. Thus can compute plans to achieve its goals:

Utility-Based Agent:
Does not only have knowledge about specific goals but also has more general way of evaluating the benefit of being in a situation which it can use to guide its actions:

Learning Agent:
Considerably more sophisticated than previous types. Has a critic module to evaluate its own performance, a learning module that modifies its own performance algorithm as well as incorporate new information. Can even generate 'experimental' actions to help it learn:
