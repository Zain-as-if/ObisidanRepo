<h4>Choice Of Heuristic</h4>
Two relatively straightforward heuristics that one might apply to his puzzle:
1. *h(state)* = number of tiles in *state* that are not in place they should be in the goal state
2. *h(state)* = sum of **Manhattan Distances** from position of each tiles in *state* to its position in goal state

**Manhattan Distances** is sum of distances in the horizontal and vertical directions. 
<h4>Evaluating Heuristics</h4>
Evaluate by calculating their **Effective Branching Factor** over set of problems by comparison with BFS.

In BFS number of Nodes *N* generated in exploring search tree with branching factor *b* to depth *d* is given by:
$$ N = 1 + b + b^2 + \dots + b^d $$
If we use some heuristic function, this equation not applicable, but will still have values for *N* and *d* for each successful search. 

From these we use above formula to calculate *b*, to calculate the effective branching factor *b*, as if we were using ordinary BFS. By averaging over number of problems get a good measure of the heuristic (closest to 1 is best).
<h4>Comparison Of Admissible Heuristics</h4>
Heuristic only admissible if it always underestimates the distance to goal.

If *h<sub>1</sub>* and *h<sub>2</sub>* are 2 heuristics for same problem and for all states *s* we always have *h<sub>2</sub>* >= *h<sub>1</sub>* we show that *h<sub>2</sub>* dominates *h<sub>1</sub>*.

For admissible heuristics the dominant heuristic is always better.

Since heuristics don't overestimate the distance to goal, higher value is always closer to the true distance - hence more accurate.

More accurate heuristics gives better guidance towards the goal.
<h4>Finding Heuristics By Constraint Relaxation</h4>
Good way of finding heuristic is by considering a distance measure for a simpler, less constrained version of the problem.

E.g. 8-Puzzle can be considered as problem from moving tiles from one grid to configuration to another under the following conditions:
- Only one tile can move at a time
- Tile can only move one space at a time
- Tile cannot move on top of another tile
Consider how by relaxing (i.e. removing) one or more of these constraints we get problems where distance to the goal is exactly given by one of 8-Puzzle heuristics mentioned (Number of misplaced tiles and Manhattan Distance).
<h4>Iterative Improvement Algorithms</h4>
In algorithms we have looked at so far, solution has been cast as sequence of steps to a goal. In cases where only goal is important we have considered steps that build towards a complete solution in stages.

Alternative approach to finding a solution is iterative **improvement**, basic idea is:
Start with complete (but defective or sub-optimal) state configuration and make modifications to improve quality. 

When doing iterative improvement normally use heuristic that is a **positive** measure of 'goodness' of each state (high is good). Hence we look for modifications that **increase** the value of the heuristic. 

Iterative improvement also be used for constraint satisfaction type problems.

In such cases we allow states to violate certain constraints and then define heuristic that measures how good a state in terms of number of constraints that are violated.

For instance in the N-Queens problem, can use heuristic based on the number of 'clashes' arising in a state - i.e. the number of queens that lie on taking a move of another queen.

Iterative improvement would then proceed by looking for ways to move one of the queens that reduces the number of clashes.
