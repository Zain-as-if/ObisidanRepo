**Heuristic** is a rule of thumb, a good way of evaluating something which is not theoretically possible.

In context of search, heuristic functions used to compute estimates to guide the choice of nodes to expand.

Typically use heuristic function that estimates the cost of getting from any given state to goal state - i.e. cost of remaining path to goal.

Thus we want function that gives low value for states that we think are likely to be near the solution and high value for those far from solution.

A good heuristic often requires ingenuity. In case of route-planning search, simple and often very effective heuristic given by estimating the cost from each node to the goal to be the **straight line distance** from the node to the goal.

Clearly straight line distance will always be <= to the distance along an actual path of the network. 

This heuristic usually good because for many transport networks, when choosing next leg of route, mostly best to head towards destination (can be exceptions).
<h4>Search Using Heuristics</h4>
Heuristic function gives indication of which nodes likely to be the 'best' choices in search for a solution.
In queue-based search, heuristic can be used to order the nodes in queue. Called **best-first** search.
Since heuristic only gives **estimate** of how close a node is likely to be to solution, will not always tell us which is best.
<h4>Greedy Search</h4>
Simplest 'best-first' search algorithm simply orders node queue according to heuristic function. Always expand the node with the lowest value of the heuristic. Children of the expanded node then merged into queue according to heuristic function ordering.

<h4>Properties Of Greedy Search</h4>
Greedy search simple and can be effective. 
Limitations:
- Susceptible to 'false starts' and other inefficient behaviour
- Incomplete - If infinite branches may carry on forever, never trying alternatives that were rated less good by heuristic but lead to solution
- Non-Optimal - No guarantee of finding lowest cost solution
- Time and Space Complexity both b<sup>n</sup>, where b is branching factor and n is maximum depth of search tree
<h4>A* Search</h4>
Avoids many problems of greedy search. Takes account of cost expended in getting to a node (like Uniform Cost Algorithm).

Expand nodes in order of lowest value of the heuristic f(n): 
$$ f(n) = c(n) + h(n) $$
Where c(n) is the cost of getting from initial state to node n, and h(n) is heuristic estimate of cost of getting from node n to goal state. 

Thus f(n) gives estimate of total cost of getting from initial state to goal going via node n.

<h4>Admissible Heuristics</h4>
A* Search usually conducted using heuristic function that is admissible:
Heuristic *h* admissible if its estimate *h(n)* of cost to get from node *n* to goal state is always <= to the actual cost of minimum path from *n* to goal state.

Admissible heuristics often describes as optimistic since they tend to indicate that goal is closer than it actually is. 
<h4>Properties Of A* Search</h4>
Provided used with admissible heuristic, has nice properties: 
- Complete - always finds solution
- Optimal - always find a minimum cost path to solution
- Time and Space Complexity - both exponential in solution path length
Admissibility required for these properties as it ensures that no node ignored because it is considered further from solution than it actually is.
